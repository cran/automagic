\usage{
automagic(directory = getwd())
}
\arguments{
\item{directory}{folder to search for R and Rmd files}
}
\description{
Searches a given directory for all R and R Markdown files, parses them for
required packages and attempts to install them from CRAN. More importantly,
if a `deps.yaml` file was made using \code{\link{make_deps_file}}, automagic
will use this rather than try to install based on a best guess.
